# ShareSDK For Flutter

### ShareSDK is a social sharing component that provides social functions for apps, like authorization and share, and has social statistical analysis management background.

#### Due to the version of Flutter, this plugin will raise a can't found heard file error in a Swift used Flutter app project. So we remake a new plugin for ShareSDK, support all APIs, nothing changed.

#### Developers please go to: [sharesdk_plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/sharesdk_plugin) . Thank you for your support～🙏

> This plugin still worked!!
